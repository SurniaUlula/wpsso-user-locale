WPSSO Core add-on to provide a convenient locale / language / region selector in the WordPress admin toolbar.

== Description ==

<img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-user-locale/assets/icon-256x256.png">

**Provides a convenient locale / language / region selector in the WordPress admin toolbar.**

**Perfect for translators or anyone that needs to switch languages quickly and easily:**

Allows logged-in users to change their preferred locale / language / region setting right from the toolbar menu, instead of having to modify their user profile settings.

The default behavior of WordPress is to apply the user locale preference *only* to the admin back-end &mdash; this plugin can extend the user setting preference to the front-end webpage as well.

The front-end locale selector is optional, and can be enabled / disabled in the SSO &gt; User Locale settings page.

<h3>Do you use the Polylang plugin?</h3>

If the Polylang plugin is detected, the locale selector will automatically use the correct Polylang language URLs.
