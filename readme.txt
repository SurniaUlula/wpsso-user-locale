WPSSO extension to add a user locale / region / language selector in the WordPress back-end and front-end toolbar menus.

== Description ==

<p><img src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-user-locale/assets/icon-256x256.png" width="256" height="256" style="width:33%;min-width:128px;max-width:256px;float:left;margin:0 40px 20px 0;" />Add a "User Locale" menu item for users in the WordPress admin back-end admin and front-end toolbar menus.</p>

Allow users to easily change their preferred locale / region / language instead of having to update their profile page.

The default WordPress behavior is to apply the user locale preference to the back-end only &mdash; this plugin can optionally extend the user locale preference to the front-end webpage as well (enabled by default).

= Do you use the Polylang plugin? =

If the Polylang plugin is active, the "User Locale" menu will automatically use the correct Polylang language URLs for the current webpage.
