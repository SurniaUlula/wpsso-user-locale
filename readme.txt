WPSSO extension to add a user locale / language selector in the WordPress admin back-end and front-end toolbar menus.

== Description ==

<p><img src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-user-locale/assets/icon-256x256.png" width="256" height="256" style="width:33%;min-width:128px;max-width:256px;float:left;margin:0 40px 20px 0;" />Add a "User Locale" menu item for users in the WordPress admin back-end admin and front-end toolbar menus.</p>

Allow users to easily change their preferred locale / language instead of having to update their profile page.

The default WordPress behavior is to apply the user locale / language preference to the back-end only &mdash; this plugin can optionally extend the user locale / language preference to the front-end webpage as well (enabled by default).

If the Polylang plugin is available, the "User Locale" menu will use Polylang language URLs for that locale.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong> &mdash; WPSSO Select User Locale (WPSSO UL) is an extension for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO)</a> plugin, which <em>automatically</em> creates complete and accurate meta tags and Schema markup for Social Sharing Optimization (SSO) and SEO.</p>
